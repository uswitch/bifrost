- You will need an account on [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com) and be a member of the MastodonC organization.

- You will need to be logged in to that account from docker's point of view (You only need to do this once).

```
docker login
```

- You need to arrange to have docker listening on a tcp port... It should start with a command like (no trailing slash on the tcp://* bit):

```
/usr/bin/docker -d -H fd:// -H tcp://localhost:2375
```
